# Image-processing-for-industrial-part-recognition
Developed a machine vision software system based on visual C＋＋ 2017 and openCV library, to recognize and localize industrial parts, providing information for a manipulator platform to achieve the next grabbing step.   Algorithms are implemented including:  Pretreatment(contrast enhancement, noise suppression, etc)  Edge detection(Sobel operator, Canny operator, Hough transformation, etc)  Center and Corner point detection  Developed an algorithms to calculate the position, size, relative coordinates and rotation angles based on the information above.
